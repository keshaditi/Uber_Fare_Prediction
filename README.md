🚕💵📊 Uber Fare Prediction Machine Learning Project 💰
This project utilizes Python and its machine learning libraries to predict Uber trip fares. After extracting and analyzing the dataset in Google Colab, 
a predictive model is trained, and an interactive user interface is built with Streamlit for real-time fare estimations.
